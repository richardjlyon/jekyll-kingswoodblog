So, after Â£2,000 expenditure, I have a Badger fence which is visible with the naked eye from space:

The Badgers, being distinctly unimpressed,  have switched to using the other sett entrance on the other side of the wall.

I have chosen to believe that I shall be able to grow excellent apple espaliers on it, when the time comes.
