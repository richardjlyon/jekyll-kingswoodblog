Title: The energy problem

**Why build a zero energy house?**

Two thirds of all the energy consumed in the world comes from hydrocarbon sources — coal, oil, and gas. The major systems that support our way of life  — industrial agriculture, global industrial manufacturing, global transportation — only work with those hydrocarbon energy sources. 

There are three, very serious problems with that arrangement. 

The first problem is that no other energy sources provide the combination of energy density, transportability, stability, convertibility and energy ‘profit’ that these systems depend on. 

## Batteries not included
We can’t run on electricity the industrial manufacturing and global transportation systems upon which the manufacture of solar and wind devices depends. Worse, hydrocarbon boosts the amount of food available to us through irrigation, fertilisers, pesticides, refrigeration, transportation and processing and we can’t replace those inputs with electricity either. Without hydrocarbon, we can’t build renewable energy devices, or feed ourselves.

## Is it hot in here?
The second problem is that our atmosphere has reached the limit of its ability to absorb the carbon dioxide that is emitted when hydrocarbon is burned. Daily measurements of CO2 now exceed 400 parts per million for the first time in three million years [1] and the International Energy Agency warned (two years ago) that we are headed for irreversible climate change in five years [2].

## Fuel warning light
And the third problem is that the quantity of hydrocarbon energy available to us has reached its all time peak and is now starting to decline at an accelerating rate.

Although we act as though we are free to ignore the limit imposed by our atmosphere, it is this last limit which we are not free to ignore in the short term, and which propels this from a theoretical problem in the distant future to one which will affect us in the timescale of a mortgage.

In matters of scarcity, supply must balance demand. The first problem — the inability of renewable energy technologies to power their own manufacturing processes — mean there can be no renewable energy solution to this issue. Together with the second and third problems — the inability to find more carbon energy sources, or burn them if we could — means there is no supply solution to this problem.

The only rational response therefore is to radically reduce demand. And since the largest demand for energy most of us make in our lives is through our homes, the only rational step we can take is to reduce the energy required *by* our homes.

And that is why we need passive houses.
