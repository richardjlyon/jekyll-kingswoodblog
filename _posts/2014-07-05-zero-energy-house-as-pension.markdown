**How to add a guaranteed £100,000+ to your pension fund.**

Your energy bill is not like your vacation bill. You can choose not to go on holiday. You can't choose not to heat your home. Reducing your energy bill by £1,000 is exactly like increasing your income by £1,000. Matters get interesting when you work out how much of a pension lump sum that is equivalent to. 

The average annual dual fuel energy bill in the UK is £1,420. It's currently rising at 10% a year as energy becomes scarcer [1]. Assume that can be reduced to only 5% per year increase. At that rate of increase, the average energy bill will be £3,100 a year by the year I retire (2030).

So I'd need £3,100 in the year I retire to fund my energy needs, and that amount would have to increase 5% a year so that I could keep funding them.

Legal & General pension company will [let you estimate](http://www.legalandgeneral.com/annuities/pension-annuity/annuity-calculator/)  how much of a pension lump sum you'd need to generate an income of £3,100 a year that increased at 5% per year. 

It's £110,000.

So owning a zero energy home is like having an extra £110,000 in your pension fund.

## A bird in the hand ...

But it's even more valuable than that. 

The UK pension fund is insolvent. The money that I might hope I will be paid when I retire has not been created yet. The people who promised me it assumed that, by the time I retired, the money necessary to fund my payments would have been created by economic growth.

Instead, the economy will contract. The money that was supposed to fund my pension will never be created. [Estimates vary](https://encrypted.google.com/#q=uk+pension+fund+gap), but by one the shortfall for the public sector pension system alone is now over a trillion pounds [2].

So the £3,100 a year of pension income I'd need at retirement to fund my energy needs doesn't exist, and never will.

But the elimination of my £3,100 a year energy expenses exists now. So not only does a zero energy house act like a pension, it acts like a guaranteed pension in a world where there will be no pensions at all. 

Value that, Legal & General.
