Planning permission was secured by the previous owner for an "Earth Ship" style of house, which is all the rage on _Grand Designs_.

It's an ugly thing. We can do better.

The house will reinstate, or rather replace, a pre-war concrete water tank. The tank itself is about 10 meters wide, 8 metres deep, and 8 metres high. The 340 million year old solid rock of Corstorphine hill has been blasted, and the tank is half recessed into it. The result is a fantastic oppotunity for a split level house that takes advantage of the rising ground.

The Architect and I meet and draw out the first rough sketches, literally on a napkin. We'll grub out the tank and replace it. Then we'll build a box the same size on top, but rotated through 90 degrees. This creates a raised terrace area accessed through wide glass doors. He produces sketches:

I've no idea how big this is, so I rough it out in [Google SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com), with my current apartment alongside for scale:

It's fine. But I'm not keen on the internal stair case. I don't need a lot of space, but the stairwell consumes a lot of internal space â€“ probably where the grand piano will go. Can we make the staircase external to the footprint of the building?

Even better. But what will the planners think?
